              <h4>Code</h4>
              <h5>Build, break-it-better, build</h5>
              <p>Hack on your ideas using any technology you like. Meet other people and form teams. We'll provide drinks, food and internet so you can focus on just building cool stuff. We'll also try to organise 15-minute talks on various technologies throughout the weekend, so we can all learn while hacking as well.

              <h4>Sun</h4>

              <h5>Tech + good weather = l33t</h5>
              <p>If you live abroad, forget rain and clouds. We have 326 days of sunshine every year. When you're done with coding, you can hit the beach in no time. During the event, we'll make sure that it's always cool and nice, and we'll provide plenty of refreshments, always, free of charge.

              <h5>Rewards for your hard work</h5>
              <p>
                Sponsor-permitting, we also want to give out prizes to the best ideas, prototypes and implementations. We haven't worked out the details yet, but presentations will probably take place during the last hour of the event on Sunday. A team of judges and your own input will determine the winners. All these over beers!
